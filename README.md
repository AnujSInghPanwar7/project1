# Complete C++ Calculator

## Overview
This project implements a feature-rich calculator application in C++ that mirrors the capabilities of modern PC and mobile calculators. It combines basic arithmetic with scientific functions, memory storage, and a graphical user interface for an intuitive user experience.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Scientific operations: sine, cosine, logarithm, exponentiation, factorial, and more
- Memory functions: store, recall, and clear values
- Calculation history tracking for reviewing past operations
- Modular, object-oriented code design promoting clean architecture and extensibility
- Interactive GUI built with Qt for ease of use (also includes console interface for quick testing)
- Robust error handling and input validation

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AnujSinghPanwar7/project1.git
2. Open the project in Qt Creator (recommended) or your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
4. For console version, run the executable and enter calculations as prompted.
5. For GUI version, interact via buttons on the interface.

## Usage
- Enter operations directly with numbers and operators in console mode.
- Use buttons for number input, operation selection, memory functions, and scientific functions in GUI mode.
- View past calculations in the history panel.
- Supports extended features like unit conversion and number base calculations (planned for future updates).

## Design Approach
- Uses Object-Oriented Programming principles such as Strategy Pattern to select specific operations dynamically.
- Separates core engine from the UI for modularity.
- Easy to add more functions or extend UI components.
